# Database Connection

## Selected Database
We have selected the MySQL database for the project. The reason bewing this choice is that MySQl has many advatanges, like:
Código aberto: O MySQL é um software de código aberto, o que significa que você pode usá-lo, modificá-lo e distribuí-lo livremente.

**Easy to Use**: MySQL is easy to install and use. Its command line interface and its documents are simple and intuitive.

* **High Availability and Scalability**: MySQL offers high availability and scalability, allowing it to be used in small, medium and large projects. It supports data replication, clustering and other scalability techniques to meet ever-growing workload demands.

* **Support for ACID transactions**: MySQL supports ACID transactions, which means that it is capable of guaranteeing data integrity in case of system crashes or continuity.

* **Security**: MySQL offers advanced security, including data encryption, user login, and permissions management.

* **Compatibility**: MySQL is compatible with a wide range of programming languages, including PHP, Python, Java, .NET, and many more.

* **Active Community**: MySQL has a large community of developers and users who are constantly working to improve it and fix any issues that may arise.


## JPA

JPA is a Java framework that simplifies the development of Java applications that need to interact with a database. 
It provides an ORM framework that allows you to work with data as objects rather than SQL statements, supports caching and transactions, and can be used with many different database management systems including MySQL. 
While JPA can simplify your code, improve performance, and ensure data integrity, there may be a learning curve and it may not be the best choice for all projects.
