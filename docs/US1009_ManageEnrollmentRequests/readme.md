# US1009 â€” As a Manager, I want to approve or reject students applications to courses

## 1. Context

---

The system should allow the manager to approve or reject students enrollment requests to courses.
This is one of the possible paths to enroll definitively a student in a course, the other being by *bulk enroll through a csv file*.

## 2. Requirements

---

It is required that the following use cases are implemented:

* **UC 1009.1** As a Manager, I want to list enrollment request to a course.
* **UC 1009.2** As a Manager, I want to approve a student enrollment request to a course.
* **UC 1009.3** As a Manager, I want to reject a student enrollment request to a course.
* **UC 1009.4** As System, I want to register the approved student in the course.

The first Use Case is highly dependent on the third one, as it is a direct consequence of the first one.

### Client Clarifications

#### Forum (Doubts)

* **Doubt 1:** "We would like to know what are the requirements for a student to be accepted or rejected from an application to a course."

  **Answer:** "[...] I think the system should only register the reason for the decision."

## 3. Analysis

---

Enrollment requests have a course, a student (eCourseUser) and a state (approved, rejected, pending).
Having this in mind, we must follow this steps:

1. The manager must be able to select a course (In "ENROLL" state);
2. The manager must be able to select a student request (In "PENDING" state);
3. The manager must be able to approve or reject the student request;
4. The system must register the decision and change the state of the request to "APPROVED" or "REJECTED".
5. The system must register the student in the course.

As we know, a student can frequent multiple courses, but can only enroll into the same course once.
This is only problematic in the "Approve Student Request" case, as the request would lead to a duplicate enrollment.
To prevent this situation to happen, before fully approving the request, the system checks if the student is already enrolled in the course.

A clear example to demonstrate this possibility:

**Scenario:**
1. A student is enrolled in a course through the Bulk Enrollment feature;
2. The same student, had a pending request to enroll in the same course;
3. The manager approves the request;
4. The system wouldn't be able to register the student in the course, because the student is already enrolled in the course.

### 3.1. Use Case Diagram

A use case diagram was created to represent the use cases that are related to this user story.

![US1009_UCD](ManageEnrollmentRequestUCD/ManageEnrollmentRequestsUCD.svg)

## 4. Design

There is a common class diagram for all the use cases.

As for the sequence diagrams, they're different for each use case.
*Reminding that due to the dependency level between UC.1 and UC.3, the sequence diagrams work as a whole.*

### 4.1. Class Diagram

![US1009_CD](ManageEnrollmentRequestCD/ManageEnrollmentRequestsCD.svg)

### 4.2. Sequence Diagrams

**[UC1009.1] As a Manager, I want to list students enrollment requests to a course**

![US1009_SD1](ListEnrollmentRequest/ListEnrollmentRequestSD/ListEnrollmentRequestsSD.svg)

**Special Considerations**

* "ListCoursesByStateService" is used to find the courses that are currently in "enroll" state.
* The loop is used to allow the selection of multiple enrollment requests, without being redirected to the main menu again.
* As mentioned in the diagram, both "alts" (alternatives) represented in the diagram are represented with further detail in the upcoming sequence diagrams.

---

**[UC1009.2] As a Manager, I want to approve a student enrollment request to a course**

![US1009_SD1](ApproveEnrollmentRequestSD/ApproveEnrollmentRequestSD.svg)

**Special Considerations**

* The system must first try to register the student as a now participant of the course selected in the enrollment request.
* The above situation has two possible outcomes, being the first success meaning that the student was registered and the other being the opposite.
* If the registration was successful, the enrollment request will also be updated and should become -> "ACCEPTED".
* The manager has to provide a reason for approving the student's enrollment request to the course (if none is provided, the system will by default mark it has "No reason provided!").

---

**[UC1009.3] As a Manager, I want to reject a student enrollment request to a course**

![US1009_SD2](RejectEnrollmentRequestSD/RejectEnrollmentRequestSD.svg)

**Special Considerations**

* The enrollment request will be updated and should become -> "REJECTED".
* The manager has to provide a reason for rejecting the student's enrollment request to the course (if none is provided, the system will by default mark it has "No reason provided!").

---

**[UC1009.4] As System, I want to register the approved student in the course**

![US1009_SD3](RegisterEnrolledStudentSD/RegisterEnrolledStudentSD.svg)

**Special Considerations**

* Related to the process above referred, to be considered as a valid candidate for the registration, the student must not be already enrolled in the course.

---

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

Some main patterns used in this user story as a whole are:

* **Single Responsibility Principle + High Cohesion:** *Every class has only one responsibility, which leads to higher
  cohesion.*
* **Open/Closed Principle:** *We could've considered the first 2-use cases to be one and share a controller, but that
  would lead to possible hard times in the future if we wanted to have more flexibility with what to do with the enrollment requests.*
* **Dependency Injection:** *Instead of instantiating the repositories or services that will be used inside the classes,
  they are received by parameter.*
* **Information Expert:** *The EnrolledStudentRepository is the IE of the EnrolledStudents.*
* **Low Coupling + Dependency Inversion:** *All the classes are loosely coupled, not depending on concrete classes,
  rather depending on interfaces.*

Overall, the SOLID and GRASP principles were applied.

| Test Case | Description                                          | Expected Result               |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|

|     3     | Create an enrolled student with invalid eCourse user | Exception is thrown           |
|     4     | Create a duplicate enrollment request                | Exception is thrown           |
|     5     | Ensure enrollment request can become accepted        | Truthful comparison           |
|     6     | Ensure enrollment request can become rejected        | Truthful comparison           |

**Each test is coupled with a setup to provide a more flexible and understandable test environment**

* Register a duplicated enrolled student

````java
 public void setUpValidButStudentIsAlreadyEnrolled() {
        // Valid Repositories
        this.enrolledStudentRepo = mock(EnrolledStudentRepository.class);

        this.enrollmentRequestRepo = mock(EnrollmentRequestRepository.class);

        // Valid Student
        this.user = UserDataSource.getTestStudent1();

        // Valid Course
        this.course = new Course("Test Course", "Test Course Name",
        "Test Course Description");

        // Valid Enrollment Request
        enrollmentRequest = new EnrollmentRequest(course, user);

        // "Save" the Enrolled Student
        when(enrolledStudentRepo.findByCourseECourseUser(course, user)).thenReturn(Optional.of(enrolledStudent));
}

@Test
public void ensureValidEnrolledStudentIsNotCreatedByTheBuilderWhenStudentIsAlreadyEnrolled() {
        // Arrange
        setUpValidButStudentIsAlreadyEnrolled();

        // Act

        .withECourseUser(user)
        .withCourse(course)
        .build());
}
````

* Ensure enrollment request can become accepted

````java
public void setUpValidCourseAndECourseUser() {
        // Valid Student
        // this.userStud = UserDataSource.getTestStudent1();

        // Valid Course
      this.course = new Course("Test Course", "Test Course Name",
        "Test Course Description");
}
@Test
public void ensureEnrollmentRequestStateCanBecomeApproved() {
        // Arrange
        setUpValidCourseAndECourseUser();

// Act
final EnrollmentRequest enrollmentRequest = new EnrollmentRequest(this.course, this.userStud);
        enrollmentRequest.approveEnrollmentRequest("Test Reason");

        // Assert
        Assertions.assertTrue(enrollmentRequest.approvedEnrollmentRequest());

**Important**

*In the demonstration, we can see some key points about this User Story.*
*It is visible that the "manager" managing enrollment requests can either accept or reject the available requests.*
